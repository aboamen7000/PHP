// C++ Programming Language : [Middle Level Language]
-------

[Low Level : Machine Main Language] : code considers as (0101000)

- efficient
- less memory
- fast

- difficult to understand (01010001) : ibrahim (0100010100010101010)
- it take time to write the code 

#==========
[High Level : Python, Java, C#, Javascript] :

- easy to understand 
- slow
- uses a lot of memory
- difficult to work with low level hardware [Factory Machines]

#==========
Middle Level : (C, C++)

- C : mother of language, also it work between high and low language level, 
      as well, that why most of factory depend on using C, in there machines works.

- also every language uses by C, like python, implenetation is CPython.

- C++ : is a extension from C, if u know C then you know about a bit of C++.

- C : is hard language cause is not low,high level,
  it middle soto know it the most important.

so what we need, to start:

- ide (text editor) [For example : Visual Code (vscode)] : https://code.visualstudio.com/

- GCC compiler : GCC is an integrated distribution of compilers for several major programming languages. 
                 These languages currently include C, C++, Objective-C, Objective-C++, Fortran, Ada, D, and Go


extensions
- c/c++ : implement the extensions for the work.
- code runner : to run the code.
